## 2024-05-24 - Externalize Hardcoded API Keys
**Vulnerability:** A hardcoded Google Maps API key was found in `index.html` within the script `src` tag.
**Learning:** Hardcoding API keys in frontend files directly exposes them to source control, which poses a risk of unauthorized usage, especially for billed APIs like Google Maps.
**Prevention:** Externalize configurations to a dynamically loaded script (`config.js`) that is added to `.gitignore`. Implement a `config.example.js` for development template and use a dynamic loader for script injection. When deploying via Docker, use an entrypoint script to generate the configuration file from secure environment variables at runtime.
